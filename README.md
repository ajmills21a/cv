# Curriculum Vitae

This repository holds my CVs and uses ```resume.sty``` from [Cies Breijs](https://github.com/cies)' [repository](https://github.com/cies/resume) as a base.

As an alternative to this my LinkedIn page is also available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajmills21a/).

## Branches

Multiple CVs are available for different job roles, these versions are held in branches as described below.

- base - this is the base CV, it's completely empty but is a good base to build upon
- master - this is my main CV and will likely be the most up to date
