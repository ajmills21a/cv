# Curriculum Vitae

This repository holds the latex source for my CVs and uses `resume.sty` from [Cies Breijs](https://github.com/cies)' [repository](https://github.com/cies/resume) as a base.

## Download the CV

The up to date pdf version is available as `cv.pdf` for each branch.

Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajmills21a/cv/base/cv.pdf) to download a pdf of my main CV.

My LinkedIn page is also available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajmills21a/).

## Branches

Multiple CVs are available for different job roles, these versions are held in branches as described below.

- `base` - a base template for building new CVs, if building your own CV then you use this as a base.
- `master` - this is my main CV and will likely be the most up to date
- `hostelling` - this cv is targeted at travelling and working in a hostel

## Building

I recommend you see the [Cies Breijs](https://github.com/cies)' version of this section [here](https://github.com/cies/resume).
