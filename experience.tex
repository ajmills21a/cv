	{\bodytext{Nublue is primarily a Magento (1\&2) house and the first year or so was spent as a Magento developer. After a while however I took on a new client as the sole back-end developer, requiring me to develop most of the back-end functionality as well as be one of the core participants in frequent meetings with client lasting up to a full 7 hour day. This was a fairly large CakePHP project and from then on I primarily worked in CakePHP and Laravel. Throughout my time at Nublue I worked with MySQL or similar variants.}}
